As many Civil and Environmental Engineers work in the Nordbau, it should definitely have a connection to that department as well. The TUM doesn't have a timber building at the StammgelÃ¤nde, so it would be nice to see that the TUM actually cares about progressional architecture and provides us with a new timber faculty building.
